# Early Graphics Investigation

I wrote some bad code, attempting to copy a pretty neat
[article](http://www.helixsoft.nl/articles/circle/sincos.htm). Who knew image
rotation and projection could be so straightforward.


## Future Improvements

- [ ] Don't make an image, write to an updatable canvas
- [ ] Add keyboard commands to interact: Possibly `pyglet`?
- [ ] Possibly make a game of it
